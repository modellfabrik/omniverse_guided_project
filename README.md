# Omniverse Guided Project

Repository to track code, assets, and progress for the Omniverse-based simulation and control environment.

## Current Goals (as of 05.08.2025)

- [x] **Set up Isaac Lab (Add. ROS2 + MoveIt) for robot control**  --> UR control via standalone python script as well.
      _Assigned: Yuvesh_

- [x] **Create 3D models of items/components used in RoboCup@Work scenario**  --> sourced items online
      _Assigned: Patrick_


- [x] **Set up mobile robot platform with camera and obtain live camera feed**  
      _Assigned: Jonas_

- [x] **Investigate how scenes with objects are loaded through standalone Python scripts**
- [x] **incl. YOLO detection workflow** 
      _Assigned: Jonas_  
      ➤ Goal: Enable interactive simulation scripts and future training workflows
      ➤ Query: Do we still have the first robot cell from the Modellfabrik?

- [ ] **Robot control based on YOLO detection**

Out of scope
- [ ] **Import custom RoboCup gripper as an asset**  
      _Upcoming_
- [ ] **Design a more complex maze for RoboCup simulation**
